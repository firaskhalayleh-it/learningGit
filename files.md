| Merge Conflicts           | Occur when developers make conflicting changes to the same content in Git.                             |
| Types of Conflicts        | - Git Fails to Start: Due to pending changes in the working directory or staging area.                 |
|                           | - Git Fails During Merge: Conflicts between the local branch and the merging branch.                   |
| Resolving Conflicts       | Manually edit conflicted files, remove markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), and commit changes.         |
| Tools to Identify Conflicts | - `git status`: Shows conflicted files.                                                              |
|                           | - `git log --merge`: Lists conflicting commits.                                                        |
|                           | - `git diff`: Helps identify differences.                                                             |
| Tools to Resolve Conflicts | - `git merge --abort`: Exits the merge process.                                                        |
|                           | - `git reset`: Resets conflicted files to a known state.                                               |
| Collaboration Tips        | Effective communication and collaboration minimize conflicts.                                          |
|                           | Familiarity with Git tools enables efficient conflict resolution.                                      |
| Third-Party Tools         | Some tools offer streamlined support for managing merge conflicts.                                     |
